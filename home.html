              How I came to Spaceland, and what I saw there: An unspeakable
              horror seized me. There was a darkness; then a dizzy, sickening
              sensation of sight that was not like seeing; I saw a Line that was
              no Line; Space that was not Space: I was myself, and not myself.
              When I could find voice, I shrieked aloud in agony, "Either this
              is madness or it is Hell." "It is neither," calmly replied the
              voice of the Sphere, "it is Knowledge; it is Three Dimensions;
              open your eye once again and try to look steadily." --Edwin A.
              Abbott, <span style="font-style: italic">Flatland</span>

            <h2>welcome to my new and improved website!!!</h2>
            <p>
              I wanted to switch things up, so here's my new website! I have
              tons of doodles in the margins of my notes from class, so I
              decided to scatter them around my website. I was inspired by
              <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a> and the
              <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/"
                >geocities archive</a
              >. This site is still under construction, but I hope you enjoy
              :^). <br /><br />
